Description:
This is a simple web-based number guessing game built with HTML, CSS (optional), and JavaScript. The goal is for the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.

ðŸ”§ How it Works:
A random number between 1 and 10 is generated when the page loads.
The user enters a guess into the input field and clicks the Check button.
If the guess is correct, the game congratulates the player and displays "Right".
If the guess is incorrect, the game deducts a point from the score and shows "Wrong".
The initial score starts at 10, and each wrong guess decreases it by 1.
An alert pops up when the user guesses correctly.
